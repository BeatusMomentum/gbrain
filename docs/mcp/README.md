# Connect and administer GBrain MCP

Choose the task first. Connecting a harness and administering the server use
different credentials.

| Task | Start here | Required access |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Run an HTTP MCP server | [Deployment](DEPLOY.md) | Access to the brain host and its service configuration |
| Open the admin panel or manage clients | [MCP administration](ADMIN.md) | The running server's separate owner bootstrap credential |
| Connect an existing agent | [Hosted harness setup](../guides/hosted-harness-access.md) | Native OAuth/PKCE, or a private machine-client handoff |
| Run a local MCP pipe | [Local stdio](DEPLOY.md#local-stdio-zero-setup) | A local GBrain installation; no HTTP admin panel is created |
| Diagnose a failed connection | [Recovery table](ADMIN.md#recover-a-failed-step) | Start with the failed stage and the authority you actually hold |

**For agents:** read [the MCP access skill](../../skills/mcp-access/SKILL.md).
If skill tools are unavailable, the instructions here and in
[ADMIN.md](ADMIN.md) work directly. A connected harness can also read
`gbrain://capabilities` for its effective permissions and administration guidance.

**Owner administration is separate from MCP `admin` scope.** An OAuth access
token, client secret, or ordinary MCP connection does not authorize dashboard
login, client creation, or client revocation. A public PKCE client has no client
secret. Ask the server-hosting harness or a separately authorized administrator
to perform owner actions.

Say to that administrator: “Open the admin panel for my running GBrain server.
Use its configured endpoint and protected owner credential. Give me a fresh
single-use login link without opening it yourself.”

Say to the connecting agent: “Connect this harness to my hosted GBrain. Use its
native OAuth flow if available; otherwise use a private machine handoff. Follow
the hosted setup guide and report configuration separately from an observed
connection in this harness.”

## Search and query result rows

`search` and `query` return their rows as compact JSON in the first content
block. Remote callers get **lean rows** by default: the fields an agent acts
on, without the ranking diagnostics that made each row several times longer
than its evidence text.

A lean row keeps `id` (the `fetch` key), `slug`, `title`, `type`,
`chunk_text`, `score`, `effective_date`, `source_id`, `chunk_id` (with
`slug` and `source_id`, the `assemble_evidence` hit), `evidence` and
`create_safety` (the duplicate-page guard). It also keeps every safety or
provenance marker that is present: `injection_suspected`, `injection_p`,
`unverified`, `content_flag`, `status`, `superseded`, `superseded_by`,
`message_id`, `thread_id`, `source_subject`, `modality` when not `text`,
`stale` when true, and `delivered: {"truncated": true}` when evidence
delivery cut the text.

```json
{"query": "acme-example renewal terms"}
```

```json
[{"slug":"contracts/acme-example-msa","title":"MSA: Acme Example","type":"contract","chunk_text":"Payment terms: Net 45. Renewal is annual.","chunk_id":812,"score":0.91,"source_id":"default","effective_date":"2026-04-02","id":"gbrain-page:v1:WyJkZWZhdWx0IiwiY29udHJhY3RzL2FjbWUtZXhhbXBsZS1tc2EiXQ","evidence":"keyword_exact","create_safety":"probable"}]
```

Pass `fields: "full"` to get every field (`page_id`, `chunk_index`,
`chunk_source`, `keyword_hit`, `cosine`, `base_score`, boosts, rerank and
graph signals, the full `delivered` object):

```json
{"query": "acme-example renewal terms", "fields": "full"}
```

`_meta.retrieval.rows` reports `"lean"` or `"full"` for every remote call.

| Client | Rows by default | How to get full rows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Any MCP client (stdio or HTTP) | lean | `fields: "full"` per call, or the host sets `gbrain config set mcp.result_rows full` |
| gbrain thin CLI, this release or later | full (it sends `X-Gbrain-Client`) | nothing to do |
| gbrain thin CLI, older release | lean | upgrade the CLI, or the host sets `mcp.result_rows full` |
| Trusted local CLI (`gbrain search`, `gbrain call`) | full | nothing to do |

The host setting is read per request over OAuth HTTP and at start-up for
`gbrain serve` (stdio), so restart a stdio server after changing it. The
`X-Gbrain-Client` header selects a row shape only; it is not an identity
claim and never grants access.

Say to your agent: *"Search my brain for the acme-example renewal terms and
show me every ranking field for the top result."*
